# Sentwit

A modular approach to creating a web-app that determines how twitter users are feeling about a particular keyword.

Enter the keyword in the text box on which you want to track the twitterati sentiments. A live line chart shows you the following emotions:  
**`Anger`, `Fear`, `Happiness`, `Sadness`,** and  **`Surprise`**.
Each emotion is given a score between `0` and `1`.
